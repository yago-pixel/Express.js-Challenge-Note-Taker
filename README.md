# My Note Taker

## Description
My note taker is an app, that allows you to take and delete notes quickly.
The UI is very simple to use.
I learned here how to use express.js to create a server-side application, that is connected to the client-side code and the front end.
Feel free to add as many notes as you like!

## Usage

My Note taker let's you write notes easily and quickly and delete them as well.

When you run the application you will be directed to the homepage. From there, you will click on the 'Get Started' button, which will take you to the actual note taker app.
